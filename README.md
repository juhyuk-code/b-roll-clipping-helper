# b-roll-clipping-helper

This repository now includes:

- `src/BrollCurator.jsx`: a compact prototype component representing the current interaction model.
- `docs/architecture-review.md`: deep architecture review, risk analysis, and a proposed production-ready target architecture.

## Why this PR

The goal of this PR is to document architectural risks before publishing and scaling the project.
